        <h2>How does SecretShare work?</h2>
        <p>
          SecretShare lets you share sensitive information through one-time, self-destructing links.
          The flow is simple: you paste your secret, we encrypt it in your browser, and you get a
          unique link. Send that link to your recipient — when they open it, the secret is decrypted
          in their browser and permanently deleted from our servers. No one can view it again, not
          even you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What encryption does SecretShare use?</h2>
        <p>
          SecretShare uses <strong>AES-256-GCM</strong>, a military-grade authenticated encryption
          algorithm, via the browser's built-in <strong>Web Crypto API</strong>. No third-party
          cryptography libraries are involved. Your secret is encrypted and decrypted entirely
          within your browser — the plaintext never touches our servers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What does "zero-knowledge" mean?</h2>
        <p>
          When you create a secret, the encryption key is placed in the URL fragment — the part
          after the <code>#</code> symbol. Per <strong>RFC 3986</strong>, browsers never send the
          fragment to servers. This means our servers physically cannot see or log the decryption
          key. We store only the encrypted blob and have no way to read your secret — ever.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>How does view-once burn work?</h2>
        <p>
          Each secret is stored in its own isolated <strong>Durable Object</strong> on Cloudflare's
          network. Durable Objects provide single-threaded execution, which means only one request
          can process at a time. When someone retrieves a secret, the encrypted data is atomically
          deleted before the response is sent. Even if two people click the link at the exact same
          instant, only one will ever see the secret — the other gets a "burned" message.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>How does password protection work?</h2>
        <p>
          Password protection adds a second layer of encryption on top of the URL key. Your password
          is run through <strong>PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations</strong> (per OWASP 2024 guidelines)
          to derive a strong encryption key. The secret is then double-encrypted: first with the
          URL key, then with the password-derived key. The recipient needs both the link and the
          password to decrypt. Think of it like two-factor authentication for your secret — share the
          link in one channel and the password in another.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What expiration options are available?</h2>
        <p>
          Secrets can be set to expire after <strong>1 hour</strong>, <strong>24 hours</strong>,
          or <strong>7 days</strong>. Signed-in users also get a <strong>30-day</strong> option.
          When a secret expires, the encrypted data is permanently wiped — only minimal metadata
          is kept briefly for status checks, then that is cleaned up too. Expired secrets cannot
          be recovered.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What are the best practices for sharing?</h2>
        <p>
          For maximum security, send the SecretShare link through an <strong>end-to-end encrypted
          channel</strong> like Signal, WhatsApp, or encrypted email. If you use password protection,
          send the password through a <strong>different channel</strong> than the link — for example,
          send the link via Slack and the password via text message. This way, compromising a single
          channel is not enough to access the secret.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Is SecretShare scalable and reliable?</h2>
        <p>
          SecretShare runs on <strong>Cloudflare's global edge network</strong>, spanning 300+ data
          centers worldwide. Each secret is an independent Durable Object — there's no shared database
          that could become a bottleneck or single point of failure. Whether one person or thousands
          create secrets at the same time, each one is handled independently at the edge location
          nearest to the user.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What can SecretShare's servers see?</h2>
        <p>
          Our servers store only the <strong>encrypted blob</strong>, a secret ID, and basic metadata
          (creation time, expiry, and status). We never have access to the encryption key, the
          plaintext, or any password you set. Even if our servers were completely compromised, an
          attacker would only find encrypted data that is computationally infeasible to decrypt without
          the key — which only exists in the URL you shared.
